These are some notes about writing styles, text formatting, indexing, and
labels.

(This document is probably incomplete. Please le me know any issues or
suggestions you might have; Jochen)


* Formatting

  Please keep all text within 79 columns. Using emacs this will be
  automatically done for you using autofill and file-styles set by the "Local
  Variables" section.

  Do not use tabs, use an appropriate number of spaces instead.

  All code samples should be put into verbatim environments and start in column
  1.  LaTeX will indent them according to the style. Put the '#' of code
  comments in column 40 (when startting at col. 0) if at all possible.

  Try to avoid boldface or explicit italic at all cost. Use \emph{}. For code,
  variables and such always use the markup constructs described in "Documenting
  Python" at http://www.python.org/doc/current/doc/doc.html.




* Labels

  A label consists of several parts, separated by colons:
      type:chapter:description

  The /type/ describes the type of material you are labelling, possible
  prefixes are "part", "cha", "sec", "fig", "tab", "func".

  The /chapter/ is a abbreviated form of the chapter this label is defined in.
  It gives a rough topical classification and helps to avoid name clashes.
  Examples are "LA", "RNG", "FFT".

  /description/ finally should give a complete and unique description of what
  it is this label refers too.



* Indexing

  The python markup constructs automatically create index entries for function
  and data definifions. Add indices to the text as you see fit. Arrange
  submodule indices under a submodule namespace, evtl. you can create a
  /see/-entry in the global namespace at the beginning of the modules chapter.



Local Variables:
mode: text
mode: auto-fill
fill-column: 79
indent-tabs-mode: nil
ispell-dictionary: "american"
