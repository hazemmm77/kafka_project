Release Notes for numarray-0.6

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

I. ENHANCEMENTS

1. Repackaging

numarray has been modified from a collection of Python modules into a
Python package.   See Doc/Repackaging in the source distribution for
more details.

2. Median Filter Function

See numarray.image.combine.median for a function which computes the median
pixels in a stack of images.

3. Thread Safety Work

Modifications to ufunc caching and IEEE error handling enable numarray to
work in multi-threaded programs.  This is barebones support, not thread
awareness.

II. BUGS FIXED

733534 Broadcasts of non-array sequences fails 
733535 NA_typeNoToTypeObject sometimes fails 
736674 PyArray_ContiguousFromObject() fails for some scalars 
750320 CharArray.raw() is broken
750326 building RPMS fails
754836 Missing Src/_convmodule.c during setup
756050 chararray multi-d copy fails for recarray
772519 memory.new_memory() 64-bit scanning bug
See

for more details.

III. CAUTIONS

1. Due to the distribution repackaging, numarray-0.6 will not install
correctly on top of an existing numarray installation. Before
installing numarray-0.6 remove your old version of numarray.
