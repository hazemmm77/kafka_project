Numarray 0.3.5
---------------------------------

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

Version 0.3.5 is a bugfix release:

1. Fixed bug in numarray.NumArray._copyFrom which broke array copies within an 
array. Basically, an array copying part of itself onto another part of itself
produced incorrect results.

2. Cleaned up setup.py to avoid generating code unless actually installing.  Now you
can ask setup.py for help ("python setup.py --help") without feeling like it's running 
wild.

3. Modified LinearAlgebra2.MLab to avoid use of properties, potentially making it work
with Python versions < 2.2.  Since there's still no regression test for MLab, this is iffy,
but "mean", at least, appeared to work.  E-mail jmiller@stsci.edu if you find numarray 
MLab problems.
