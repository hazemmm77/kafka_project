Numarray 0.3.3
---------------------------------

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

Numarray-0.3.3 features improved support for arrays of complex
numbers, re-implementing complex types using generated code.  In
addition to being faster, the new complex ufuncs are better integrated
with the numarray type system, so operations between numarrays and
complex scalars now work properly.  This release also fixes a problem
experienced by RedHat Linux users installing numarray from source.
