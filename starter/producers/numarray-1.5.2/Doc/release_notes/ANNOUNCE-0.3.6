Numarray 0.3.6
---------------------------------

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

Version 0.3.6 has 2 bugfixes and 1 new feature:

1.  sort/argsort implementations were fixed to better handle
pathlogical cases with many equal values.

2. NDArray.tofile() and _bytes.copyToString() were fixed to properly
handle multi-megabyte multi-dimensional arrays.

3. The default array repr has been changed to summarize output for
arrays with more than 1000 elements total.  This feature is configured
by the functions arrayprint.set_summary and arrayprint.summary_off.
