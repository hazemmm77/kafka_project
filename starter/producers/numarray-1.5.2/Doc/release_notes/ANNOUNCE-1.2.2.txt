Release Notes for numarray-1.2.2

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, arrays of
heterogeneous records, string arrays, and in-place operation on 
memory mapped files.

I. ENHANCEMENTS

1. Support for user defined universal functions with arbitrary numbers
of parameters.  See numarray/Examples/ufunc/setup_special.py

2. Additional modifications to support numarray operation with scipy_base.

3. Import time roughly halved thanks to Rory Yorke.

4. Improved sorting functions from Chuck Harris.

5. Simplified array() and fromfile() from Rory Yorke.

6. Port of Numeric's dotblas extension for faster matrix
multiplication when linked against ATLAS, LAPACK, BLAS, etc.

7. Improvements to array indexing speed from Francesc Alted and Tim
Hochberg.
