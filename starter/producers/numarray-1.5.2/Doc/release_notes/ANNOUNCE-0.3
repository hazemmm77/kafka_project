Numarray 0.3
------------
Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotion semantics.

Numarray-0.3 incorporates safety checks to prevent crashing Python
when a user accidentally changes private variables in numarray.

The new safety checks ensure that:

1. Numarray C-functions are called with properly sized buffers.
2. Numarray C-functions are called with properly aligned buffers.
3. Parameters match the C-function in count and i/o direction.
4. The correct generic function wrapper is used to call each C-function.
5. All indices implied by the array strides are valid.

Failed checks result in python exceptions.

A new memory object fixes an unforunate limitation of the python
buffer object, namely the lack of guaranteed double aligned storage.

The largest generated source module, _ufuncmodule.c, has been
partitioned by data type into several smaller, more gcc-friendly
modules, e.g. _ufuncFloat64module.c.

The sort and argsort functions are fixed.
The dot function is fixed for 1D arrays.
Transpose, swapaxes, and reshape once again return views.
