Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, arrays of
heterogeneous records, string arrays, and in-place operation on 
memory mapped files.

Release Notes for numarray-1.3.3

I. ENHANCEMENTS

None.  1.3.3 fixes a fatal problem with embedding numarray and loading
it more than once.  It also fixes some numarray memory leaks
associated with restarting the Python interpreter.

II. BUGS FIXED / CLOSED

1233431	Add 'type' to fromfunction()
1230490	Numarray: integer overflow in sum() is not detected
1216688	ufunc's ignoring complex operand
1213675	Problems embedding after 1.1.1
1209946	Mac OS-X --use_lapack
1212975	numarray.fromfunction(...) misbehavior
1209929	config.h and Python-2.2
1235278 Add -lm to numarray link lists

II. BUGS FIXED / CLOSED

1152323	/usr/include/fenv.h:96: error: conflicting types for 'fegete
1185024	numarray-1.2.3 fails to compile with gcc-3.4.3

Release Notes for numarray-1.3.0

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, arrays of
heterogeneous records, string arrays, and in-place operation on 
memory mapped files.

I. ENHANCEMENTS

1. Migration of NumArray.__del__ to C (tp_dealloc).  Overall performance.

2. Removal of dictionary update from array view creation improves
performance of view/slice/subarray creation.  This should e.g. improve
the performance of wxPython sequence protocol access to Nx2 arrays.
Subclasses now need to do a.flags |= numarray.generic._UPDATEDICT to
ensure that dictionary based attributes are inherited by views.
NumArrays no longer do this by default.

2. Modifications to support scipy.special.

3. Removal of an unnecessary getattr() from ufunc calling sequence.
Ufunc performance.

II. BUGS FIXED / CLOSED

1179355	average() broken in numarray 1.2.3
1167184	Floating point exception in numarray's dot()
1151892	Bug in matrixmultiply with zero size arrays
1160184	RecArray reversal
1156172	Incorect error message for shape incompatability 
1155538	Incorrect error message when multiplying arrays

See
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=450446&group_id=1369&func=browse
for more details.

III. CAUTIONS

This release should be backward binary compatible with numarray-1.1.1
and 1.2.3.
