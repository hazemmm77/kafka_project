Release Notes for numarray-0.8

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

I. ENHANCEMENTS

1. Peter Verveer's nd_image package!

Peter Verveer has contributed a fully documented multi-
dimensional image processing package, numarray.nd_image.
Thanks Peter!  

(A manual for numarray-0.8 is currently unavailable but will be
forthcoming)

2. Masked Arrays

Numarray now features a port of Paul Dubois Masked Array package, MA,
now called numarray.ma in numarray.

3. Improved packaging

The entire distribution is now a single package.  This means binary 
installations can be accomplished with a single install file.

4. Unified testing

The selftest format has been improved so that doctest is used for all
packages and can be executed via a single top level command:
numarray.testall.test().

II. BUGS FIXED

 839415  Error mode comments from Tim Hochberg
 839409  array comparison return booleans
 839407  ``take`` is really only useful for array types
 839404  ``array_repr`` no longer supports `suppress_small``
 839396  ``Error.popMode`` should raise if last mode is popped
 839395  ``anArray.conjugate()`` acts in place
 839393  ``argmax`` returns shape () arrays instead of scalars
 839388  ``where`` and others do not appear to use asarray
 839385  add.reduce takes dim as an argument instea
 839382  na.searchsorted does not accept scalars for 2nd argument
 839378  numarray.dot doesn't accept scalars, Numeric.dot does
 839377  Assigning a Numeric slice to a numarray array fails
 839374 linear_algebra.determinant` returns length-1 vector
 839372 Mixing arrays and lists in array() fails
 839370 sqrt, power, ** fail on complex zero*
 832609 Bug in putmask type casting
 830219 Segmentation fault
 829184 [Numpy-discussion] Incorrect OverflowError

III. CAUTIONS

1. numarray extension writers should note that the documented use of
PyArray_INCREF and PyArray_XDECREF (in numarray) has been found to be
incompatible with Numeric and has therefore been deprecated.  numarray
wrapper functions using PyArray_INCREF and PyArray_XDECREF should
switch to ordinary Py_INCREF and Py_XDECREF.
