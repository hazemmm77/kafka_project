Numarray 0.3.1 and 0.3.2
---------------------------------
Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

Numarray-0.3.1 incorporates a number of bug fixes and enhancements to
the C-API, including a minimal Numeric emulation layer which makes it
easy to port simple Numeric C-extensions to numarray.  The emulation
layer is incomplete, so not all Numeric extensions will work, but
simple ones *do* with a minimal amount of effort.  See
Doc/numpy_compat for an example of convolution done using the
emulation layer.  New for Numarray-0.3.1 is the Numarray manual in PDF
and HTML formats;  other formats are available for users if the source
distribution.

Numarray-0.3.2 is a source only release to support Alpha/Tru64.  It is
essentially Numarray-0.3.1 + one portability bug fix.
