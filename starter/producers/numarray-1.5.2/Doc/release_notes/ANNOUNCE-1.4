Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, arrays of
heterogeneous records, string arrays, and in-place operation on 
memory mapped files.

Release Notes for numarray-1.4.0

I. ENHANCEMENTS

1. Speed improvement for numarray operators.  The Python level hook
mapping numarray operators onto universal functions has been moved
down to C.

2. Speed improvement for string-array comparisons, any(),
all(). String correlation is ~10x faster.

3. Better operation with py2exe to help it automatically detect the
core numarray extensions to include in an installer.

4. scipy newcore compatible lower case type names (e.g. int32 not Int32)

5. scipy newcore 'dtype' keyword and .dtypechar attribute.

II. BUGS FIXED / CLOSED

1323355  	Apps fail with import_libnumarray
1315212 	Infinite loop converting some scalar strings into a list
1298916 	rank-0 tostring() broken
1297948 	records.array fails to create empty fields
1286291 	import sys missing from array_persist.py
1286168 	Generic sequences in ``strings.array()``
1236392 	Outdated web link in announcements
1235219 	LinearAlgebraError not imported in linear_algebra

III. CAUTIONS

This release should be backward binary compatible with numarray-1.3.x
