Numarray 0.3.4
---------------------------------

Numarray is an array processing package designed to efficiently
manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays.  Numarray is modelled after
Numeric and features c-code generated from python template scripts,
the capacity to operate directly on arrays in files, and improved type
promotions.

Version 0.3.4 implements the following new features:

1) Support for Int64 arrays on Alpha/Tru64.  These are now the default
integer type on Alpha/Tru64.  

2) Better Numeric compatability in terms of the array() function parameters
and typecode handling.

3) Ports of Numeric's FFT, RandomArray, and LinearAlgebra packages as
FFT2, RandomArray2, and LinearAlgebra2.  These names are likely to
change in the future as they are better packaged.

4) Support for pickling of numarrays, chararrays, and recarrays.

5) Bugfixes

For the astronomers out there, Numarray-0.3.4 supports PyFITS-0.7.2.
