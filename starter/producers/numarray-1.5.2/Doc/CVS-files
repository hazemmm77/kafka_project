This file gives the rationale for the inclusion of some files in cvs that don't
/obviously/ belong there:

- MANIFEST: This file is not correctly generated by some python on some
  platform (probably python-2.0 on Linux, please tell us if you know better!).

- Src/_*module.c: These files are kept in version control to make it easier to
  examine how changes to the master files actually translate into the real
  code.
